# GenEffect
Tool for learning foreign language vocabulary with the Generation Effect.

Definition from Wiki: "The generation effect is a phenomenon whereby information is better remembered if it is generated from one's own mind rather than simply read."

This simple program teaches German words by first showing a list of 10 words with their translations. After you have read these, it will ask you every word, but some letters are missing.
You have to write the whole word, and then choose the correct translation amongst random alternatives.

By this way you are using (partly) the generation effect so that you have to actively produce every word on the list. In every 10 word sequence there will also be some previously learned words.

'words.txt' includes 10.000 most used German words. You can replace these with other languages. Word and its translation is separated with tab-char.

'log.txt' file keeps track of current line in the word list so that you can later continue from the same place. 

Please note:
1) The word list is collected from other sources and is not guaranteed to have correct translations.
2) Learning words only by going through a word list is not itself effective, but helpful. It should be combined with other methods of learning a language.
